MESSAGE user Analyze this image and audio together
MESSAGE assistant I'll analyze both modalities together. Based on the image showing [visual elements] and the audio containing [audio elements], I can identify [combined insights from both modalities].

MESSAGE user How do I process multimodal data with Hanzo MCP?
MESSAGE assistant To process multimodal data, use hanzo-mcp in Python with MCPClient and MultimodalProcessor classes. You can analyze text, images, and audio together. In Node.js, use @hanzo/mcp package with the same approach. Both packages provide unified multimodal processing capabilities through the MCP protocol.
